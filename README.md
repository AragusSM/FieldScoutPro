# FieldScoutPro
Team makbots scouting application

Source code files for the application developed in swift.
In order to properly access these files, you must own an IOS device
with xcode installed, or another swift compatible IDE.

The xcode project and workspace are missing from this package
and must be created, but the assets as well as the implementation
should be intact.

In addition, this application uses Alamofire, an API used for 
HTTP networking especially for IOS programs. Ensure that
Alamofire is installed in some way or form in your project.

**********************************************************

The code features a graphic user interface that records and collects data
for the FIRST FTC Skystone game, the competition in 2019-2020.
Since this is an outdated event, implementation details must be changed accordingly,
but the source code can be transformed in order to fit the current year's requirements.

In addition, the URL link in the source code is connected to a google spreadsheet
owned exclusively by FIRST robotics team MAKbots. Please replace the link with a sheet of your own.
Finally, the entries in the code file will have to be changed as well. 
In order to do so, please visit this link: https://puravidaapps.com/spreadsheet.php

The link is a detailed set of instructions to send data to google sheets for analysis.
Although the tutorial is based on MIT app inventor, the source code copies this format
using Alamofire.
